I am probably too lazy to write something about it right now.
I reached +2200 tokens / minutes with it.

I haven't coded for more than 6 months and I did this project only to have fun and learn, that's mainly why I'm posting it.
I know some bums will want to skid it and resell it, but I don't care. I hope that people who want to progress will learn from this project, you're on the right track.

The code is probably very ugly because the more time went by, the more functions I added without paying much attention.
